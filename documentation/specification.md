You should use the reference project’s file as a guide. That is, your specification should contain the following sections:

The purpose of your project, which is a short text description of what your project is
Users, which describes what kinds of user roles your program’s users will have
For example, a study app could have the following roles: Student, Teacher, Administrator, Parent
If your app only has one type of users, then you can skip this section. This is common especially in video game projects.
Planned features
You can list these features as bullet points
Describe the core functionality that you will have in greater detail
Make a separate list for extension ideas that you can implement if you have extra time, after you have completed the main project
You can also make a user interface mockup in the specification document. This is optional.
