Purpose:
To build a program that plays the card game solitaire
Planned features:
-interface where you start
-ability to play solitaire
Core functionality:
The core is clearly going to be the solitaire game itself. I guess the core functionality of that would be the ability to generate a new, solvable puzzle each time a player chooses to play. You can split that into even more core functionalities, like generating and shuffling the deck. Something also related to this will be the ability to recognize what moves are legal, as well as the ability to track the state of the game.
Extension Ideas:
-making it look nicer
-maybe adding a button gives an explanation of how to play
-adding difficulty choices
-adding different versions of solitaire
